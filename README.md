subnet-divider
==============

This script gets IP network and network mask pair in CIDR notation, divides them to a predefined number of parts and shows Network Address, Netmask, Broadcast, Gateway, Host Range and Host Count information.

To run the script properly, execute:

`./subnet_divider.py 192.168.0.0/24 2`

The code is fairly enough documented.
